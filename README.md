# Background

One of my favorite hobbies in my spare time is DJing, and I am especially motivated to spread the music featured in my mixing sessions to as many people as possible via YouTube. 
This has resulted in an extensive personal music library and it has become a challenge to keep track of it all.
Rather than creatiing a simple spread sheet, I have decided to utilize my skills in .NET to create a solution for myself that is both scalable and always available. 

RMD is a personal tool under development designed to help me keep track of all the individual tracks in my collection and most importantly if each track has been featured on my YouTube channel or not, thus ensuring completely fresh mix sessions.
